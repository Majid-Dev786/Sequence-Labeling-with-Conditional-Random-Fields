# Sequence Labeling with CRF in PyTorch

## Project Overview

This project implements a sequence labeling system using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) in PyTorch. 

It is designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks but can be adapted for other sequence labeling problems. 

The model incorporates an LSTM network with CRF for efficient and accurate sequence tagging.

## About The Project

This Python script focuses on sequence labeling tasks using Conditional Random Fields, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER). 

It employs PyTorch's neural network capabilities alongside the TorchCRF library for sequence tagging, showcasing the powerful combination of LSTM networks and CRF models.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- TorchCRF

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Sequence-Labeling-with-Conditional-Random-Fields.git
   ```
2. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install torch TorchCRF
   ```

## Usage

This model can be applied to various NER tasks across different domains, such as medical records, customer support data, and document processing. 

The script trains the model with your dataset and provides methods for both training and inference, making it straightforward to integrate into existing projects.

## Real-world Applications

Sequence labeling with CRF is crucial in many NLP tasks. This implementation, in particular, can be used in:
- Extracting information from medical records (e.g., symptoms, medications).
- Processing legal documents for specific entities (e.g., names, places).
- Enhancing customer support systems by identifying key aspects in inquiries.
